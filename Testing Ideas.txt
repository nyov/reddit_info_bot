Bugs:
Bot needs to check the time of last comments, if they are older than a (set time) then ignore.  This is because if the bot is restarted, it will comment on everything it just did unless the next part is fixed (but will still recomment if a mod has removed or deleted the first post.  We dont want to piss mods off.)

Bot still isn't correctly checking to see if itself has already commented. (not sure why its not working)
Make bot check entire thread to make sure it hasnt commented. 
Add Search regex to key words.  It is finding nearly anyword right now.

If interested in another $50 addon pay in order of importance:

- A way to handle numerous (all_comments = r.get_comments(subreddit = r.get_subreddit)subreddit+subreddit+subreddit.  Current max string is 1024.  Needs to handle close to 12000+ -  Possibly use r/all but then check it against a DB that holds the subreddits?
- A config file that handles all settings that can manually be changed in the bot.  (ease of use)
- Bot will not make any comments on keywords or search string, if the link is not a image, gif, html.  ie it will ignore video and text posts.
