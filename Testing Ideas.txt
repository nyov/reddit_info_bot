Bugs:
✓ Bot needs to check the time of last comments, if they are older than a (set time via .cfg file) then ignore.  This is because if the bot is restarted, it will comment on everything it just did.
✓ Bot still isn't correctly checking to see if itself has already commented. (not sure why its not working), but the above fix will resolve this.
✓ Make bot check entire thread to make sure it hasnt commented. This will fix Line 3's bug.  Its not double responding, its just responding to the same thread multiple times.
✓ Add Search regex to Key Words List.  It is finding nearly anyword right now.

✓ Fix error for when comments are deleted, before the bot can respond.

New Feature Requests, in order of importance:

✓ - Ability to filter any link found on google or bing, as well as it's raw text.  Must be able to handled ALL filter (except user and image) from this site:  http://spambot.rarchives.com/  - Must check against this site, as it is the main source of reddits nsfw subreddit filters.  This is a requirement per the mods.
✓ - A way to handle numerous (all_comments = r.get_comments(subreddit = r.get_subreddit)subreddit+subreddit+subreddit.  Current max string is 1024.  Needs to handle close to 12000+ subreddits. -  Possibly use r/all but then check it against a DB that holds the subreddits?
✓ - A config file that handles all settings that can manually be changed in the bot.  (ease of use)
✓ - Ability to scan for Key Words List, with the option in a .cfg to change it to "comment, PM, Log"
   ✓ -comment would reply to the comment, as it is right now.  PM would send a pm to the person instead of commenting, Log would just log to screen.
✓ - Bot will not make any comments on keywords or search string, if the link is not a image, gif, html.  ie it will ignore video and text posts.
